# WordleForToday
Yea WordleForAnyDay
So i scraped the wordle website using Beautiful soup and the resultant text is the wordle .txt,
I have not included the beautiful soup scraper as it is slow and ineffective to request the page and then parse again so 
to make things simple i have attached the scraped wordle.txt

#WARNING
  Spoilers Ahead
To run  
1.Run setup.py once
2.Run final.py
Thats it 
You will see your desired word for that date
Enjoy!
