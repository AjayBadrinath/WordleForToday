# WordleForToday
Yea WordleForAnyDay



I was too bored so tried this 

So i scraped the wordle website using Beautiful soup and the resultant text is the wordle .txt,
I have not included the beautiful soup scraper as it is slow and ineffective to request the page and then parse again so 
to make things simple i have attached the scraped wordle.txt

#WARNING
  Spoilers Ahead


To run  


1.Run script.py once(This will setup 2 binary files where we will parse data)or click on wordle.py file and you are set



2.Run final.py


Thats it 


You will see your desired word for that date


Enjoy!

#Just a side note 
Since the wordle domain was acquired by nyc .Hope that they do not  mess up the source html file
md5 hashes do remain the same as it was previously [0686bbfe8947308a054893ff0207e257] and now has changed to [b8599b74783d9b02874f5ebc0dc8ef0e]
But as of now this tool works!!!
The new website has removed 23 words so i have updated the same
